This study examines the effect of changes in local funding on the quality of long term care services. To describe the prevalence of quality inspections and the transition between different qualit ratings over time we fit semi-parametric hazard models on administrative data. Our findings suggest that care homes placed in local authorities with substantial financial constraints are likely to be inspected les frequently. Also, these constraints have a negative effect on the improvement of the rating as well as a positive effect on the deterioration of the quality. The former results imply that more public funding may be not necessarily helpful for preserving good quality specially in care homes with bad management.","tags":["Care homes","local government","quality","long-term care","England"],"title":"Local budgets and quality in care homes: a duration analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eduardo Gonzalo Almorox"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"bdd8b7f3c7ceedbaaaddd7f8c10a05b8","permalink":"/publication/closures/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/closures/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper is the first to present evidence for the English care homes market on the causal effect of care home closures on other care homes in the market. The effect is a priori ambiguous. To identify the effect of closures I use an IV strategy on public administrative data that exploits the fact that care homes closures may be the result of a consolidation strategy from their care provider group to preserve its financial situation and carry on with its long term care activities. The main results show that incumbent care homes downgrade their quality after the closure of a care home nearby. The effect is moderate and decreases over time. I explore several explanations for this finding investigating mechanisms based on the frequency of quality inspections carried out by the regulator and alternative destinations where residents may go in the event of closure. I find an increase in the number of inspections of remaining care homes whereas do not find evidence of an increase in the proportion of people providing informal care in the local authority or in emergency admissions of the nearest healthcare centre to the closed care home.","tags":["Care homes","quality","long-term care","England","closures","market"],"title":"The effect of care home closures on the quality of care homes nearby","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eduardo Gonzalo Almorox","Volodymyr Bilotkach","Nils Braakmann","John Wildman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"02ebade75d471bafe72dc1a2c7906966","permalink":"/publication/houseprices/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/houseprices/","section":"publication","summary":"High house prices are often considered to be beneficial for the elderly due to the accumulation of wealth. However, as land is an input in the provision of public services, the elderly might be harmed by them, for example, due to a shortage of local care homes. Alternatively, care home providers might be attracted by asset-rich potential clients, which could lead to a positive effect of house prices on the provision of care. Applying an instrumental variables approach on English data, we show that higher house prices lead to fewer care homes, fewer entries into the market as well as fewer available beds. Yet, we also show a positive effect on the proportion of care homes with high quality.","tags":["Care homes","house prices","long-term care","England"],"title":"The effects of house prices in long term care markets: Evidence from England","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Coming soon \u0026hellip; !\n","date":1536447600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536447600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"Coming soon \u0026hellip; !","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"What is this about?
