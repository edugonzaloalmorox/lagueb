# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Since 2010 English local authorities have experienced major  changes in their public finances which have resulted in more local fiscal constraints. This study examines the effect of changes in local funding on the quality of long term care services. To describe the prevalence of quality inspections and the transition between different qualit ratings over time we fit semi-parametric hazard models on administrative data. Our findings suggest that care homes placed in local authorities with substantial financial constraints are likely to be inspected les frequently. Also, these constraints have a negative effect on the improvement of the rating as well as a positive effect on the deterioration of the quality. The former results imply that more public funding may be not necessarily helpful for preserving good quality specially in care homes with bad management."
