abstract = "This paper discusses the suitability of queuing theory as a component in economic evaluations. Receiving timely acute care is of major concern to patients, health care providers, and policy-makers. Underlying capacity constraints associated with the provision of care might be neglected in economic evaluations. When they are considered, the type of models usually employed are both data and computationally demanding. We argue that queueing modelling may be an appropriate framework to use within economic evaluation when capacity constraints play an important role. We illustrate the role of queuing theory using a dataset with 33,926 records, corresponding to one year activity of the ambulance service from the North East of England. We use these data to explore alternative scenarios about the ways in which services can be centralised. The results of the model are expressed in terms of waiting times and allow for the identification of possible inefficiencies within a system. Results may also inform the design of potential policies for the reorganisation of emergency care which take into account the resource constraints analysed."
