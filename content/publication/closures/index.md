abstract = "This paper is the first to present evidence for the English care homes market on the causal effect of care home closures on other care homes in the market. The effect is a priori ambiguous. To identify the effect of closures I use an IV strategy on public administrative data that exploits the fact that care homes closures may be the result of a consolidation strategy from their care provider group to preserve its financial situation and carry on with its long term care activities. The main results show that incumbent care homes downgrade their quality after the closure of a care home nearby. The effect is moderate and decreases over time. I explore several explanations for this finding investigating mechanisms based on the frequency of quality inspections carried out by the regulator and alternative destinations where residents may go in the event of closure. I find an increase in the number of inspections of remaining care homes whereas do not find evidence of an increase in the proportion of people providing informal care in the local authority or in emergency admissions of the nearest healthcare centre to the closed care home."
