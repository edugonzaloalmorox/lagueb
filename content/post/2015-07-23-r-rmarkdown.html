<h2>What is this about?</h2>
<p>After several attempts I am finally deploying a website. This has been a long journey of trial and error where I have two main sources: <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/">This post</a> by Allison Presmanes and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syWAKaj-4ck">video</a> by John Muschelli.</p>
<p>The website is built with R <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"><code>blogdown</code></a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. It is hosted and deployed in <a href="https://www.netlify.com">netlifly.com</a>. The template is based on the <a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/">Academic</a> theme.</p>
<p>The code of this website and other projects is on my <a href="https://github.com/edugonzaloalmorox">Github</a>.</p>
